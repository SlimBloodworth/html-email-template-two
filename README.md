## My process

- This follows a workflow of build and test:
- Work structurally leaving in all table borders and cell background colors to help more clearly see what is being created, then removing them at the end.
- Work until a minor development milestone is reached, then run a test.
- Run tests through validator, accessibility checker, and spam checker.
- First: Build the skeleton - then test.
- Next: Add content - then test.
- Next: Style colors and fonts - then test.
- Next: Remove borders and backgrounds - then test.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

#### Tested with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Important notes about html email code

In HTML emails we still use XHTML Transitional 1.0 as our document type as it is the most compatible document type across email clients:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
```
Adding http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html" tells the destination rendering engine how to process text and special characters for HTML emails:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html" charset="UTF-8">
```

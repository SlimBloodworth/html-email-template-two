## My process

- This follows a workflow of build and test:
- Work structurally leaving in all table borders and cell background colors to help more clearly see what is being created, then removing them at the end.
- Work until a minor development milestone is reached, then run a test.
- Run tests through validator, accessibility checker, and spam checker.
- First: Build the skeleton - then test.
- Next: Add content - then test.
- Next: Style colors and fonts - then test.
- Next: Remove borders and backgrounds - then test.


### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

#### Tested with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Validator](https://validator.w3.org) - Validator used to catch mistakes and iron out details.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

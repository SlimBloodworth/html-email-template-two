## My process

- This follows a workflow of build and test:
- Work structurally leaving in all table borders and cell background colors to help more clearly see what is being created, then removing them at the end.
- Work until a minor development milestone is reached, then run a test.
- Run tests through validator, accessibility checker, and spam checker.
- First: Build the skeleton - then test.
- Next: Add content - then test.
- Next: Style colors and fonts - then test.
- Next: Remove borders and backgrounds - then test.

### Built with

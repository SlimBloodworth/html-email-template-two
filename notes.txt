~ Important things to know about HTML email development. ~

#1 - Web Dev and HTML Dev Differ
Though it is imperative to understand HTML and CSS in order to develop an HTML email, it is important to understand that it is different than web development.
There are no real, consistent standards when it comes to email development, and many of the HTML tags you might be accustomed to using in web development are not supported in HTML email development.
This is due to security standards and each email client (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc) will handle things a bit differently.
This project will use nested tables:

<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>

#2 - Styling CSS
Security does not allow for ANY external files.
This includes images and external stylesheets. 
- Styling needs to be handled by either internal styles, or by inline styles.
- Images need to be hosted online and you will need to link them.
- You can only apply ONE CLASS PER element, multiple classes are not supported.
- You CANNOT use shorthand for CSS styles in HTML as they are not supported.
For this project, inline styles will be used with any classes used in an internal style sheet.
The internal style sheet will be pulled inline by the ESP (Email Service Provider) at the end.

#3 - !DOCTYPE, <html>, and <meta>
- HTML emails use XHTML Transitional 1.0 as the document type as it is the most compatible document type across email clients.
- Add xmls="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" to the opening html tag.
- Adding http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html" to the meta tag with charset="UTF-8" tells the destination rendering engine how to process text and special characters for HTML emails. You should encode any special characters anyway.
